Marco Polo emulates the text-adventure video games of the 80s, yet it's also inspired from the eponymous board game of the same period. You assume the role of Marco Polo, the famous explorer who traveled from Italy to China and back. You must cross the entire continent of Asia, experiencing adventures and dangers, trading, and successfully negotiating with others.
