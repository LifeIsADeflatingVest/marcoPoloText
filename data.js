let endOffVenice = "The road ahead narrows as you draw closer to Venice, each step bringing you nearer to the city of your birth. The sights and sounds of distant lands still linger in your memory â€” palaces gleaming under foreign suns, spices wafting from crowded bazaars, and languages that once seemed impenetrable but are now familiar. Behind you lies the world you have explored, full of wonders and perils, yet the pull of home grows stronger with every mile. Your return will not be without fanfare, for you carry with you stories that will captivate the imaginations of those who stayed behind. Still, the journey is not over, and the road may yet test your resolve. But in the distance, Venice calls, promising rest and reunion. Soon you will see the city rise before you, its canals glistening like a dream on the horizon.";

The canals shimmer in the fading light, their waters gently lapping at the stones of the city that you once called home. The bustle of merchants and the chatter of familiar voices fill the air, yet you find yourself changed â€” your mind still adrift in the vast empires, bustling markets, and forgotten roads of the East. Your tales of distant kings, strange customs, and untold treasures will astonish the world, but they will never fully capture the magnitude of what youâ€™ve seen. As you walk the streets of Venice, every step reminds you of the journey that has shaped you into a legend. Though your travels have ended, the mark they leave will endure for generations. Welcome home â€” your legacy has just begun.";
